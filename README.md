# Beginner to Advanced Algorithm Practices
Javascript code snippets as a form of algorithms

## Source
- Majority of the algorithms are written from scratch by me as of thinking, white boarding and testing through hours of hours.
- Some of the algorithms are directly included from appropriate source as I sought out possible solution.
- Because the majority of the code snippets are written by me, there are more lines of code(LOC) as compared to best algorithms which had few lines of code solutions from various sources.
- In future I'll keep upgrading existing algorithms by newer methods, fewer lines of code and most possible test case checked scenario

Thank You!
