# CustomFactorial-Algorithm 
# First Made by me Algorithm
A javascript algorithm for calculating factorial. 
Question is why I am posting this, is i have developed it on my own after 5-6 hrs spending on such a small math function to work.
After 5-6 hrs , I tested the use cases for some tricky values , and it was obsolete and working. 
This is not major breakthrough , as many factorial algos are available online, but thing is when you want something to work with our effort,
it is fruitful for us as we can learn many things from that.
Thank You!
